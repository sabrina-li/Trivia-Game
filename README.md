# Trivia-Game

Animal themed trivia game written in jQuery

You have 20 questions and 30 seconds to answer each question. 

After each question you have 5 seconds to review the correct answer and entertain yourself with a gif(credit to Giphy). At the end of the game you will see how did you do with the number of correct vs wrong vs time's up.

You can choose to restart the game by clicking the restart button and the same set of questions will be asked.

Enjoy!
